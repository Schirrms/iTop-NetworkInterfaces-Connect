# iTop-NetworkInterfaces-Connect
Interconnects predefined interfaces on CI and on network devices instead of just naming them

By default, in iTop, network interfaces are only connected by names. So you create interfaces for a server, for a switch, and when you attemps to create a link between them, you cannot reuse the namd interfaces, you just get a text field with no relation to the actual defined interfaces;

This contribution create the link.
