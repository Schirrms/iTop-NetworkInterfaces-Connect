# iTop-NetworkInterfaces-Connect
Interconnects predefined interfaces on CI and on network devices instead of just naming them

By default, in iTop, network interfaces are only connected by names. So you create interfaces for a server, for a switch, and when you attempt to create a link between them, you cannot reuse the defined interfaces, you just get a text field with no relation to the actual defined interfaces.

This contribution let you create the link between the predefined interfaces.
